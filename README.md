## Technologies

These are some of the tecnologies used in this project:

- `commitlint`: A tool that checks your commits and ensures consistency in version control.
- `dotenv`: A module that loads a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `eslint`: A linting tool for JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- `express`: A Node.js minimalist framework.
- `husky`: A tool for adding Git hooks to automate tasks like linting, testing, or commits in JavaScript/Node.js projects.
- `lint-staged`: Runs linters on Git staged files.
- `mongoose`: A Node.js ODM for MongoDB that simplifies data modeling and queries.
- `multer`: A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
- `node`: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
- `pino`: A very low overhead Node.js logger.
- `prettier`: A code formatter.
- `socket.io`: A JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (e.g., browsers) and servers. It uses WebSocket as the primary transport protocol when supported but falls back to alternatives (like HTTP long-polling) for broader compatibility.
- `tsx`: A command-line tool and Node.js enhancement that allows you to execute TypeScript files directly without needing to explicitly compile them to JavaScript first.
- `typescript`: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
